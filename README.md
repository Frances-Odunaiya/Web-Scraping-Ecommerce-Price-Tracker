# Web-Scraping-Ecommerce-Price-Tracker
A Python-based tool for monitoring product prices across multiple e-commerce websites. This project scrapes price data, converts it to Canadian Dollars (CAD), logs it in a CSV file, and sends email notifications based on specific criteria and visualizes this using Tableau. Ideal for tracking price changes and managing budget decisions.


# Full Project will be here on July 26th, 2024
